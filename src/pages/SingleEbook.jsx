          You will learn simple but powerful techniques to support people who
          read our stories - people who have questions, concerns or fears about a
          wide range of life challenges and people who just want to share their
          thoughts with others and have fun.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You will learn how to support one person on their own, as well as how
          to work with a group. See course overview below.

          The online part of the course will take about an hour, including
          listening to the videos. You need to allow extra time for trying out
          the exercises and making your own reflective notes. You do not need to
          complete the course all at once, it will remember where you left off,
          and it will let you start again from the same place.
        </p>

          This module also includes a FREE download of our ebook, Belonging.
